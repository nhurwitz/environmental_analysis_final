After getting a diploma in biochemical engineering, he moved straight into a low-level job for a downtown branch of Simmons-Pacific, an international energy and chemical corporation. He&#39;s worked for them since, climbing the corporate rungs and impressing his superiors with his consistent creativity and diligence.

He often stays up late reading reports and proofing project proposals sent up from the 17th floor. He commutes daily to and from work, using his Octopus card to pay for the transit railway. Though the rides are crowded, he enjoys the time to clear his head. Due to the housing crisis in his district, much of his salary goes to paying rent. He splits the remainder between savings, living expenses, and collecting grandfather clocks. Wei likes to spend his weekends and vacations going out with a friend shopping or to a upscale restaurant. Downtown, he uses covered escalators or buses to move between neighborhoods. He feels comfortable with his social and professional position. His motto is &#34;Keep going! Keep going!&#34;"
